              There is not a single moment I can hone in to, where the outcome significantly changed my life.
              However, I can show you a recurring situation which is pushing my life in a definite direction.
              It only occurs outside of school in the late spring, summer, and early fall seasons; and rarely.
              The colors that represent this:
            </p>
            Light Green, Really Light Blue, Brown, and Grays:
            <p>
              As the world creates the setting around me, the colors outside change to a unique palette. <br>
              The trunks darken, leaves burst, and trees weep from the weight of the sky. <br>
              The sky itself diffuses the sun, illuminating the entire sky evenly, hiding the shadows, and letting everthing shine. <br>
              Occasionally, with the sky being so heavy, it drowns out the sounds of nearby cars.
            </p>
            Vibrant Blue, Vibrant Red, and Vibrant Green:
            <p>
              The colors outside inspire me, <br>
              I surge with energy, passion, and ideas. <br>
              Every color a computer can make starts with three colors: red, green, and blue. <br>
              So my ideas are exactly that, mixtures of red, green, and blue, mixing into anything possible.
            </p>
            Orange and Dark Grey:
            <p>
              Orange and Dark Grey are the colors that help me suspend reality, keep focused.
              They push my work out of my screen so I can manipulate it.
            </p>
            Purple, Red, and Light Blue:
            <p>
              These are the colors of my emotions defining how I work.
              The purple is a sense of nervousness, unsettlement, pushing me to work.
              The red is my energy towards my work, but also the anger that I cannot complete it all.
              And light blue is the sadness and realization that I do not have enough time for all of these great ideas.
